A to-do webapp, that's somehow hot ðŸ”¥ and cool â›„ at the same time!

## ...but why
I always think that the best way to learn in webdev is by doing projects you're passionate about. Welp, I had the idea, so it it only fair I learned Redux and React along the way.

## what I used
  * [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
  * [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
  * [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
  * [randomatic](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/randomatic) (for generating unique IDs)
