# donefire âœ”ðŸ”¥
A to-do webapp, that's somehow hot ðŸ”¥ and cool â›„ at the same time!

## what is it?
Usually, in to-do apps, the tasks are organized by their date. In **donefire**, the tasks are ordered by their "hotness" - urgency, if you will.

## but why..?
I always say that the best way to learn, especially in development, is by doing projects you're passionate about. Well, I had the idea, so it was only fair I learned Redux and React along the way.

## what I used
  * [React](https://github.com/facebook/react)
  * [Redux](https://github.com/reduxjs/redux)
  * [styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components)
  * [randomatic](https://github.com/jonschlinkert/randomatic) (for generating unique IDs)
