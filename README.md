# donefire âœ”ðŸ”¥
I always say that the best way to learn, especially in development, is by doing projects you're passionate about. Well, I had the idea for a to-do web application, so it was only fair I learned Redux and React along the way.

## What is it?
Usually, in to-do apps, the tasks are organized by their date. In **donefire**, the tasks are ordered by their "hotness" - urgency, if you will.
